    "In the discussion scenario, each student is asked to submit posts according to the given topic while quoting other students' posts, and instructors are required to mark each student's posts according to their quality as well as correctness. Quality means the writing quality of the long text. And correctness means the relativeness between the posts and the given topic.\n",
    "In this work, we use neural network to learn semantic and syntactic information to evaluate the writing quality. To measure the correctness, we assume the posts should be relative to the given topic, so we calculate the matching extent between them. Meanwhile, quoted posts could reveal the knowledge understanding of the student, we select relative sentences from the quoted posts to evaluate the student's understanding."

However, I'm not so understand with an \"1+1>2\" effect actually. Is it like there will be various combinations while we combine two different kinds of neurons?In my opinion, even we can record all neurons' activities, who can promise the machines can record correctly? Moreover, Mitra have mentioned that animals are all individual and have different vary as well as they all get a their own environmental history. Since every human are unique and their neurons may different because of imcomplete. Hence, there are too many external factors blocking scientists to try to understand the brain although they could record all nerous. ''',\n",
    "         '''It seems we all have the same stand and similar reasons, let me further explain it. According to the video of Misenboeck(2010), since our brain and environment affect mutually, we can see that it is quiet difficult to find out or indicate when there have something happen, human's brain will take this decision. It is because everyone have their own environmental history, when we do the same trial, there might have two different outcome. Besides, Miesenboeck also mentioned that we should control the neurons rather than record the activities of neurons. Although we know the activities patterns of neurons, it doesn't mean we can decode when will they have those performances.''',\n",
    "         '''Thank you for your explanation and I also agree with your view of \"1+1>2\". According to the question, we can understand the brain if we could record all neurons' activities, although we can record all of them, it does not mean that we can explain this outcome or phenomenon, let alone to try to understand the brain, especially there might be different outcome while two or more neurons cooperating. As a result, scientist require to do lots more trial and research to know more about the brain. Therefore, human still need to put so much effort in order to understand it. Thus, i do not agree with the above statement.''',\n",
    "         '''i defiantly agree with your conclusion of that example! Although we can find that schizophrenics' brain matter only contains less than 25% gray matter in their temporal and prefrontal lobes, it can only become a characteristic of schizophrenia and can not explain why there will be less gray matter than normal brain. In the same direction, when we can record all neuron's action, we can summarize and say this phenomenon will appear under certain situations. However, we may still not find out the cause. According to the provided materials of Mitra, although the Europeans decide to construct a complete stimulation of the activity of brain of human, they have not get the necessary circuits or the information of physiology. In this case, it is similar with the question that we are discussing about. They are facing some unsolved problems. Moreover, lets change our considering direction, Mitra also mentions a main point which is just a basic knowledge of Physics that even only collective or thermodynamic behavior goes, the whole detailed information of the system's microscopic behaviour does not matter any more. It refers that the way to understand the brain are also same that don't focus to the \"microscopic\" of neurons' activities. For example, thermodynamics also came before a exhaustive microscopic dynamics' understanding. As a result, we can see that if scientist focus on other way, it might be the only and correct way to unlock the secret of human brain. Things can come different and use theory can lead them to understand the brain. Even though we don't know entire brain, we still can create some theories and then finally understand the brain because of combining different of brain and discover more and more until all thing unreavel.

    "topic = ['''If we could record the activity of all neurons, we could understand the brain. But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination, my motives are not sinister. I control the brain in order to understand how it works. Now wait a minute, you may say, how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first? Isn't that putting the cart before the horse? Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis. They say, \"If we could record the activity of our neurons, we would understand the brain.\" But think for a moment what that means. Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times, we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns, and that's so difficult, chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. Take a look at what brain activity might look like. In this simulation, each black dot is one nerve cell. The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. There's 10,000 neurons here. So you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. Your brains are about 100 million times more complicated. Somewhere, in a pattern like this, is you, your perceptions, your emotions, your memories, your plans for the future. But we don't know where, since we don't know how to read the pattern. We don't understand the code used by the brain. To make progress, we need to break the code. But how? An experienced code-breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean, it's essential to be able to play with them, to rearrange them at will. So in this situation too, to decode the information contained in patterns like this, watching alone won't do. We need to rearrange the pattern. In other words, instead of recording the activity of neurons, we need to control it. It's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some. The more targeted our interventions, the better. And I'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision.  And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose, I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries. But we'll certainly learn a lot. Now, I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. It dates back at least 200 years, to Galvani's famous experiments in the late 18th century and beyond. Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental, nugget of the neural code: that information is written in the form of electrical impulses. Galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today, despite a number of drawbacks. Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. It's hard to do in animals that run around, and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously.  So around the turn of the last century, I started to think, \"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down?\" So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain, re-engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light, overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. First, it's clearly a non-invasive, wireless form of communication. And second, just as in a radio broadcast, you can communicate with many receivers at once. You don't need to know where these receivers are, and it doesn't matter if these receivers move -- just think of the stereo in your car. It gets even better, for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in DNA. So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function''']\n",

According to Flora, Stephen (2004), positive reinforcement occurs when a desirable event or stimulus is presented as a consequence of a behavior and the behavior increases. Not only the material rewards, but also the intangible rewards are positive reinforcement too. Both of it can be a stimulus event for which students will work in order to acquire it. One good example is that students may want to get a well internship so they are motivated to work hard. In this case, the internship will be a positive reinforcement. Therefore, operant conditioning is work for improving our learning in the University life. In fact, if we can find more than one reinforcement, we can be motivated continually and then we can pursue a bettering learning in our University life. We can keep our motivation with a fixed-ratio schedule. According to Miltenberger, R. G. \"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\", schedules deliver reinforcement after every nth response. If we deliver reinforcement with a fixed-ratio schedule, operant conditioning should be worked in the long term. ]''',\n",
    "           '''I am going to explain the reason why I was said ‘if we can find more than one reinforcement, we can be motivated continually and then we can pursue a bettering learning in our University life’. That mean that student can have different reinforcement to motivate themselves in different periods. For example, promising themselves to go to trip after getting GPA over 3 which 2015_1_S246 mentioned, winning other classmates, gaining knowledge, etc. If the effectiveness of one reinforcement reduces, we can rely on another reinforcement to motivate ourselves. In fact, it is hard to keep our motivation of study with one reinforcement or goal, but no one said we can only have one goal in our university life. I hope that can solve your question. Next, I think we can use another elements of operant conditioning in our university life. There are four basic consequences which are positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, negative punishment respectively. It is possible to use these consequences at the same time to motivate ourselves. One good example is that we can set up a target or goals such as getting GPA over 3. 2 as a positive reinforcement and we need to retake if a subject’s GPA below 2 which is a positive punishment. We will study hard to pursuit a better result and avoid to retake next time. Therefore, we should not only focus on reinforcement but also punishment. If we can use that effectively, operant conditioning can play an important role in our university life and improve our learning.''',\n",

For example, the positive punishment can be applied to improve our presentation skills. Not all students have experiment in presentation, but that is necessary in our university life. If students’ presentation is not well in the beginning, they may feel frustrated and the sense of loss can be a positive punishment to motivate the student to do better next time. Also, the praise from others can be a positive reinforcement to motivate students in some cases. In the university life, we have many chances to do group project with others, so learning how to cooperate with group mates is an essential lesson we need to learn. If we are praised by others, we may have a sense of accomplishment and be motivated to do better. Next, we will avoid to be blamed by others. It can also be a negative punishment to improve our performance. Therefore, to a large extent, we can apply the operant conditioning to improve our learning in the university life in the Polyu.''',\n",

I mentioned the reasons of that in the previous discussion, so I want to discuss why I can not agree this statement fully. I think operant conditioning overlook some factors which is important in our learning and these factors can affect the effectiveness of the operant conditioning. For instance, the personality of students can affect the outcomes when they face with same stimulus. If a student, who is positive, is continually behaving badly, he/she may be motivated to get a higher performance. He/She do not want to feel frustrated next time. In the case, operant conditioning can improve his/her learning. However, if a student, who is negative, is continually behaving badly, he/she may think that is impossible and loses motivation. Therefore, operant conditioning concept cannot improve our learning in sometimes. We need to consider the real situation such as the personality to apply the operant conditioning concept to maximize the effectiveness.

    "topicNew = ['''To what extent can you apply the operant conditioning concepts to improve your learning in the university life in the Polyu? Operant conditioning (also called instrumental conditioning) is a learning process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment. It is also a procedure that is used to bring about such learning. Although operant and classical conditioning both involve behaviors controlled by environmental stimuli, they differ in nature. In operant conditioning, stimuli present when a behavior is rewarded or punished come to control that behavior. For example, a child may learn to open a box to get the sweets inside, or learn to avoid touching a hot stove; in operant terms, the box and the stove are \"discriminative stimuli\". Operant behavior is said to be \"voluntary\": for example, the child may face a choice between opening the box and petting a puppy. In contrast, classical conditioning involves involuntary behavior based on the pairing of stimuli with biologically significant events. For example, sight of sweets may cause a child to salivate, or the sound of a door slam may signal an angry parent, causing a child to tremble. Salivation and trembling are not operants; they are not reinforced by their consequences, and they are not voluntarily \"chosen\". The study of animal learning in the 20th century was dominated by the analysis of these two sorts of learning, and they are still at the core of behavior analysis. Operant behavior is said to be \"emitted\"; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why it happens in the first place. The answer to this question is like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a \"new\" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables. Reinforcement and punishment are the core tools through which operant behavior is modified. These terms are defined by their effect on behavior. Either may be positive or negative. Positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement increase the probability of a behavior that they follow, while positive punishment and negative punishment reduce the probability of behaviour that they follow. Extinction occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. Occasional reinforcement can lead to an even longer delay before behavior extinction due to the learning factor of repeated instances becoming necessary to get reinforcement, when compared with reinforcement being given at each opportunity before extinction.''',]\n",

It may be true that operant conditioning did work in the short term, like promising myself to go to trip after getting GPA over 3. However, in long-term , people might not rely on it.

    "                 '''I agree that intangible reinforcement can act as a motivation for poly u students in their study. However, what I stated in my first comment is that these kind of reward actually depends. People got different desire and target in their life. It is not a must for people can be motivated by reward. Then, let us think in this way. For example , we have got a poly student who named Student A in the class. Student A always get accomplishment from getting good result in his poly u learning. This motivate him in the very beginning but then when student A keep on getting this reward again and again. He finally tired of these kind of appreciation from people. He feels like it is already not a motivation for him to study anymore. Therefore, the next year, an other student had get a higher marks than student A in the study. We can see that not every single person can be motivated continually in their study. Also, it is not logical to say that if we can find more than one reinforcement, we can be motivated continually. There is no linkage between each of them. Can you please further explain your point by giving some examples?''',\n",

I am not fully disagree it can’t work at all. According to 2015_1_S119 ’ s example on the games, I afraid that I can’t fully agree with it. People may change the game due to the boredom instead of hoping to get any of the sense of the achievement. Also, some of you mention that the value judgement/personality can also be classified as a type of operant conditioning but actually they are totally different things. As Houts and Kassab(1997) stated that under the Rotter’s social Learning Theory, behavior may affected by the personality. Personality will act as a reinforcement power in different events. For example, if their personality or value judgement prefer more communicative and sociable, they may join in some society and become the member inside which may affect their studies (academic learning).''',\n",

It is true that operant learning can help us on learning other skills like communication. It is very important for us to build up our friend zone with our schoolmates or even the guests from different places. The reward for building good communication skills is like extending our social circle and help us in the future. Like if I am a marketing secretary in a society, I have to get used to know the guests whenever I go out to inauguration. I have to keep on improving my communication skills in order to build up relationship with them in the aim of getting sponsor. The final result of this will ends like benefiting my own work or the society which is a kind of motivation to me. Therefore, under this kind of reward, I will keep on trying to develop my social skills that is one of the most important skills learning for us. But still I think it is a short-term motivation which let me remains my original stand point.''',\n",

When we can achieve our goal(eg. getting GPA over 3),  the sene of accomplishment will be generated. With the sense of accomplishment, which can be acted as an long-term positive reinforcement, we will pursue a better learning outcome inPolyu in the following semester.''',\n",
    "                 '''I agree with what 2015_1_S231 said. The meaning of \"improve\" is different from people to people. For example, a student who failed in a subject and need to retake the course. His target may just pass the exam so that he doesn't need to tri-take the course. If he pass the subject, it can also be counted as a kind of improvement. Although his goal may be easy in someone's eyes,  he has put effort in order to achieve his goal, which is passing the exam, during the preparation for the mid-term test and the exam, For someone who have pass the mid-term test, they may seek for a higher GPA. They also put effort in preparing for the exam. This true that people will be tired about positive reinforcement and it is not a must for people can be motivated by reward. Different people have the different effect for the reinforcement and punishment. The firth one is motivated by positive punishment while the second one is motivated by positive reinforcement.  When student A who were tired to get a high GPA and let other student to be better than student A, the negative punishment may occur. We can infer that if the motivation from reinforcement or punishment disappear, Another type of reinforcement or punishment schedule may occur, pushing us to improve our learning in Poly U.''',\n",

When we hold a activity and see the positive response form the participants(a kind of positive reinforcement), we are encouraged to do well in the next event. When we see the negative comment in the social networking sites(a kind of positive punishment), we will feel like we are punished and we will be eager to improve.

    "                 '''In fact, I think that Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is similar to operant conditioning. Let me apply a bit of the theory in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to reply your opinion. I also think that the personality inserts certain effect in application of operant conditioning. It is true that someone value social intercourse or extracurricular activities more than academics study. However, I do think that positive punishment is still effective in this case. If a student who join many many activities, even negatively affecting his/her academic learning in the Poly U, they will be penalized. Most worst, he/she will be disqualified for the place in the Poly U. I think keeping a place in the Poly U can be regarded as a safety need for allPoly student. We need to satisfied this important and basic need in order to pursue the self actualization need. Suppose all university students are rationale, no matter how student underrate academic learning in the Poly U, positive punishment is still valid as students do not want to be panelized or disqualified for their degree in the Poly U. Therefore, for those who put a value on other aspects more than on academic learning, they will require themselves to have the GPA at least over 2. The positive punishment offers them a base line and remind them not to despise too much for their academic learning. This avoid them from having the GPA below 2, improving their study In the Poly U. To conclude, although personality inserts certain effect in application of operant conditioning, I still deem that operant conditioning improve our learning in the Poly U.''',\n",
    "                 '''I think that fixed ratio is more effective than fixed interval. Psychologists Rossi and Henry conducted a famous experiment about feedback effect. They divided a class into three group. The students in the first group would be informed their results immediately after having test. The student in the second group would be informed their results one week after having test.  The student in the third group would not be informed their results after having test. After a 8-week teaching, the teaching method changed. The teaching method of group 1 and group 3 swapped and the teaching method of group 2 remained unchanged. As a result, the test result of group 2 progressed stably. The learning outcome of group 1 became worse and group 3 became better suddenly. From the above experiment, the feedback from the teacher can be viewed as a kind of reinforcement when the students had a good test result or a positive punishment when the students had a bad test result. After applying a immediate feedback to group 3, their test results skyrocketed abruptly and the group 2 just progressed stably. Therefore, we can infer that the time interval between the reinforcement or punishment and the action affects the effectiveness of the reinforcement or punishment schedule. By comparing that 4 types of partial reinforcement schedule, the time interval of delivering that 2 types of ratio schedules are relativity shorter than asserting 2 types of interval schedule. Therefore, we can conclude that that 2 types of ratio schedules(fixed ratio schedule and variable ratio schedule) will be more effective than those 2 types of interval schedules (fixed interval schedule and variable interval schedule)  . To conclude, time interval affect the effect of inserting reinforcement. From those 4 types of partial reinforcement schedule, fixed ratio schedule and variable ratio schedule in more effective than the other two.''',\n",
    "                 '''I agree with all of you that operant conditioning concepts can be applied to improve my learning in Polyu. The most common example of applying operant conditioning concepts is that I can be rewarded with good grades after working very hard for studying in Polyu. It is simply because I will have the potential to outperform others and achieve a good grade (A/B+) after endeavoring to study or revise for examination in the courses. The most difficult part for improving academic results in university life is that my time has been occupied by different issues. For instance, I have to work for my part time job as a tutor for teaching Chinese in Secondary school. Also, I have to spend some time for doing exercises, preparing my tutorial classes’ teaching materials and meeting with my old friends. It occupies most of my time after school for revising what have been taught at that day. However, I can apply positive reinforcement for improving my university learning. It means that I will increase my time for revision every day and reduce the time I used in doing part time job or meeting with old friends when I can achieve a higher GPA, gain a sense of satisfaction from good examination results or even fight a precious chance to go to exchange, As a result, my academic results in Polyu can be improved through operant conditioning. What if I do not apply positive reinfocement in my university learning? ? I will probably spend even more time for doing part time job and contribute less effort to study. The foreseeable future is that I will face difficulties in understanding the knowledge of the subjects and get a low marks in examinations. It will affect my academic results or even my career as I may achieve an unacceptable gpa in this situation. Therefore, operant conditioning is very helpful to improve my learning in polyu.''',\n",

Lin (1982) suggests that our performance is affected by the learning, teaching and also the positive and negative reinforcement. Take my personal experience as an example. I am not very satisfied with the mid-term test results of psychology and economies. It is simply because I am not very focused in class as I now started to study in a relatively relaxing environment when compared to secondary school. I also not failed to get a good grade in my first psychology journal because I didn’t put much effort to do it. After receiving the unsatisfactory results, I decided to put extra effort in preparing my examinations and doing reports and papers. Also, I am now more eager to send an email to the tutors and ask questions about the content that I don’t understand in class in order to get a good grades. It represents that I use my effort to prevent from repeating to get an unsatisfactory results again. Therefore, the negative reinforcement can effectively encourage me to contribute more effort and distribute more time in learning, and, more importantly, it can help me to improve my learning in university life.''',\n",

If I am not very clear about what I want to achieve in polyu, how can I apply the operant conditioning concepts in my study? If I just want to participate in a lot of activities and feeling satisfied with getting a low grade or barely pass in examination, how can I use positive or negative reinforcement to encourage myself to learn harder? If good examination results, good grades or even the chance of going to exchange cannot gain me a satisfaction, any kind of reinforcement is simply not useful for improving my learning. Therefore, I am very agree with the student who mentioned that we should better first clarify what I want to achieve in university life. Operant conditioning can only be applied when I understand my learning objective and determine my goal in study before applying the concepts into my learning, such as getting a good grade in marketing so I can take it as major in year 2.

The biggest difference between secondary school and university is that I have a substantial chances to give presentation, deliver my opinions and communicate my ideas in class in university. Therefore, I got a great deal of chances to learn how to communicate and exchange my ideas with others. It is important that I can apply the positive or negative reinforcement to encourage myself to learn about the interpretation skills and interpersonal skills in order to facilitate my communication with others. I will be encouraged to learn communicate skills more enthusiastically whenever I am successful or fail to communicate with others. Furthermore, there are a lot of projects that require me to cooperate with others. It is natural that everyone have different ideas and opinions towards one thing. As a result, I have to learn how to compromise myself with others when I am working in a group. I have to learn how to accepts others opinions so the group work can be polished. It is also important to apply positive and negative reinforcement in this learning process, which means that I will be willing to learn about the coordination skills when it comes to group work.

    "postsSameTopic = ['''Well, operant learning is voluntary behavior. In operant learning, learning depends on what happen after the response – the consequence (Ceccarelli & White, 2015). It means that if we know what the result is, we will play the enough effort to achieve it no matter how hard it is. I also agree that academically well-behaved university students should set up a clear goal for enhancing our learning in the university. Therefore, reinforcement can be applied in that situation. Reinforcement is one of the operant learning and also the key to learning (Ceccarelli & White, 2015). I believe the theory of the partial reinforcement effect is most suitable for enhancing our learning. Partial reinforcement effect is talking about that we can expect to get a reinforcer after a few appropriate responses (Skinner, 1956). For example, I designed a study plan that I want to get a high GPA (above 3. 5). However, how can I keep going during the study? When I know the operation of partial reinforcement effect, I know how to do. High GPA is combined by various subjects’ grad. When I study a single subject like Psychology, I can set some limited aims. When I achieve some of it, for example finishing a chapter, I can get some rewards (delicious dinner or interesting movie) by myself. These rewards are reinforcement. When I, eventually, get a high GPA, I can write a nice resume, apply for exchange and even get some scholarships. All this things are also the reinforcement we expected before we study. As a result, if we set a reasonable goal to get rewards (reinforcement), we can study smoothly in our university life. ReferencesCeccarelli, S & White, J. (2015). Psychology.

    "                 '''Thank you, 2015_1_S218 agree my point that reinforcement can boost our study efficient. As 2015_1_S218 mentioned, apart from positive reinforcement, there is negative reinforcement there. When we got a good scrod after an exam, we will relax. It means when we have done something good, our stress or pressure will be removed. This phenomenon represents the negative reinforcement.     We can also discuss how to manage our study time. Studying in university, we always hear a term “Deadline fighter” which mean the student will just work hard before an exam or submitting an assignment(s). This situation can be illustrated psychology concept “Fixed interval schedule of reinforcement. ” It means the first response is rewarded only after a specified amount of time has elapsed. This schedule causes high costs of responding near the end of the interval, but much slower responding immediately after the delivery of the reinforcer (Ferster, C. B. , & Skinner, B. F. 1957). It is not the best way to study in university, right? Take me as an example, I had experienced to be a deadline fighter. I tried to save all of my greatest efforts until closer to the exam. During DSE, I attempted to study for the night before the ICT exam. I had just tried to familiar all of the MC and short question answers. As a result, the final score is not very good. It made me realize that fixed interval schedule of reinforcement is not the best strategy for studying.     Shall we discuss how to choose the best strategy to manage our time for study? Maybe we can also discuss the role of punishment in operant conditioning and in our university life later. References    Ferster, C. B. , & Skinner, B. F. (1957). Schedules of reinforcement.

We have discussed a lot of background information about operant conditioning & learning, and it is totally enough. Shall we start to discuss the action based on operant conditioning & learning?In the utilitarian path, the problem of studying in the university must be assignment and examination as both them will be counted on GPA. To enhance our learning approach, therefore, means we should have a good GPA. I believe we can set up a reasonable schedule to make our learning approach more smooth and efficient. This schedule will set the time for study and create a condition that if the study result can fill full my expectation, I can get a reward like a delicious dinner or an entertaining movie. Otherwise, if the study result cannot be filled full, I should give up my free time to study. Above schedule used the concept of the positive reinforcements (reward) and negative punishment (give up the free time). Do you think it works? ''',\n",
    "                 '''Wonderful! As 2015_1_S273 and 2015_1_S218 mentioned before, variable ratio schedule of reinforcement must be introduced in university in order to enhance our motivation for studying. However, there a significant problem here. If we want to design a suitable strategy based on variable ratio schedule of reinforcement, we should consider whether it exists in our university. If this schedule does not set up, we cannot discuss this point anymore. In fact, in my understanding, there are not variable ratio schedule of reinforcement introduced in our university. Therefore, your idea is excellent but hard to achieve in fact.      Talking about the motivation, based on the foundation of reinforcement and punishment, I think the more efficient way to enhance study performance must be self-motivation. Self-motivation relies on the intervening processes of goal setting and self-evaluative reactions to one's own behavior (Bandura & Schunk 1981). Self-motivation, reinforcement and punishment have the same goal that is motivating us to enhance study performance. The difference is that reinforcement and punishment follow to get the small awards (good exam result) and avoid to be punished (missed the deadline for assignment), but self-motivation follows self-actualized, long-term goals as well as adversity-facing. I benefit self-motivation is higher level than, but also related to, operant conditioning & learning. If we are self-motivated, we will not just focus on how much assignment we done, how many marks we get. We will focus on whether we are the dean list members, first honor, and how much awards we get. It is self-actualized which depends on ourselves rather than others. When we can be Self-motivated, we can keep pushing ourselves, even without the variable ratio schedule of reinforcement.      Therefore, after we discussed operant conditioning & learning, I think what we should do is to become self-motivated. Reference: ",

However, I will concern that if we are a university student, why can't we take responsibility for our study. The main purpose of this discussion topic is to improve our learning in the college. So, we can assume that the students, who can take responsibility for his study, will try to follow some schedule that can enhance their learning. If not, our discussion is meaningless. If we want to create a way to motivate those students who are lazy and often give up quickly, punishment may be a good choice to motivate them if they tend to fear penalties. Otherwise, significant reinforcements would motivate those students who hope to be rewarded. On the other hand, I will concern that whether the reinforcement or punishment set by professors will suit on every student. If not, these reinforcements or punishments are also meaningless.''',\n",

    "topicSame = ['''To what extent can you apply the operant conditioning concepts to improve your learning in the university life in the Polyu? Operant conditioning (also called instrumental conditioning) is a learning process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment. It is also a procedure that is used to bring about such learning. Although operant and classical conditioning both involve behaviors controlled by environmental stimuli, they differ in nature. In operant conditioning, stimuli present when a behavior is rewarded or punished come to control that behavior. For example, a child may learn to open a box to get the sweets inside, or learn to avoid touching a hot stove; in operant terms, the box and the stove are \"discriminative stimuli\". Operant behavior is said to be \"voluntary\": for example, the child may face a choice between opening the box and petting a puppy. In contrast, classical conditioning involves involuntary behavior based on the pairing of stimuli with biologically significant events. For example, sight of sweets may cause a child to salivate, or the sound of a door slam may signal an angry parent, causing a child to tremble. Salivation and trembling are not operants; they are not reinforced by their consequences, and they are not voluntarily \"chosen\". The study of animal learning in the 20th century was dominated by the analysis of these two sorts of learning, and they are still at the core of behavior analysis. Operant behavior is said to be \"emitted\"; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why it happens in the first place. The answer to this question is like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a \"new\" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables. Reinforcement and punishment are the core tools through which operant behavior is modified. These terms are defined by their effect on behavior. Either may be positive or negative. Positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement increase the probability of a behavior that they follow, while positive punishment and negative punishment reduce the probability of behaviour that they follow. Extinction occurs when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced with either positive or negative reinforcement. During extinction the behavior becomes less probable. Occasional reinforcement can lead to an even longer delay before behavior extinction due to the learning factor of repeated instances becoming necessary to get reinforcement, when compared with reinforcement being given at each opportunity before extinction.''']\n",

    "quoted_postsSameTopic = ['''That's right! It is true that a variable interval schedule can definitely help improve our study. Though the above suggested variable ratio schedule would have a possibility to boost our motivation in studying, such beautiful of motivated scenario is hard to appear. Therefore, personally, I believe variable interval schedule would be better as suggested by 2015_1_S261. Meanwhile, it is believed that fixed ratio schedule would also enhance our revision efficiently. In my personal trial, which is on progress now using the fixed ratio schedule, I set a target of going Australia for internship. However, since I am not from an affluent family, I require the help of scholarship, which means a considerable grade of GPA. My trial is, in fact, performing the schedule. Once the target was set, I was incredibly motivated and be more willing to revise my studies. Thus, using different schedules could undoubtedly encourages our learning in university life. On the basis of the experiment findings (Weatherly, 2008), comparing different kinds of reinforcement schedule, partial-reinforcement shows a better performance with greater maintenance. So, we can conclude that our motivation in studying can be improved as long as we adopt some methods by virtue of those reinforcement schedules. Reference Weatherly, N. L. (2008). A comparison of maintenance-training methods for children diagnosed with autism.''',\n",
    "                        '''Thanks for 2015_1_S264's suggestion. Your suggestion has proposed the use of positive reinforcement and negative punishment as well as the implantation of fixed ratio schedule which is the rewards after you meet your target. I believe this would work for us to encourage ourselves carrying out revision, in order to gain the reward and prevent the spare time being reduced. Yet, I still reckon the effect of such plan leaves room for doubt. Since we are all university students, the way we spend our time and the effort we put into our studies are all up to our own decision. The above suggested schedule can work only if we are able to stick to the schedule. However, students like me who are lazy and often give up easily, would need a stronger plan to force ourselves to continue the schedule, for instance, adopting a even more harsh punishment or a more attractive reinforcement such as going on a vacation after a semester. This can probably help those who are unable to follow the schedule to achieve a better result of this plan. Still, how harsh the rewards are varies among different individuals, depending on heterogeneous personalities.''',\n",

I believe learning in university not only include the academic results, but as well as other developments in the university, such as experiencing extra-curriculum activities. Aside from learning knowledges on books, learning through participating competitions is also considered as another kind of learning. For instance, participating in some competitions allow us to gain experiences. Operant conditioning can then apply into the learning. The rewards we get from the experiences act as the positive reinforcement, like the relationships we developed, the awards we may obtain or the lessons learnt from it. These rewards can also encourage us to join more events and broaden our horizon, which enhance our learning in the university life in Polyu by means of a diversity of develpment.''',\n",

Personally, positive reinforcement provide a pushing force, but I reckon with the help with punishment, the 'deadline fighter' scenario can be more improved. For instance, reduce entertainment or sleeping time in order to punish ourselves for not sticking to our own schedule. This can as well provide incentives for us to do our work earlier since we would like to prevent the punishment.''',\n",
    "                        '''For all of your opinions, i do agree with the point that we can utilize the different kind of punishment and reinforcement to enhance our study quality for achieving a better result. For examples, I would like to reward myself a day of relaxation, which can be a negative reinforcement that decrease my depression and anxiousness. And we have became a university student, self discipline should be developed, as what 2015_1_S218 has mentioned, punishment can be a tool to decrease the procrastination. Furthermore,  the schedule of reinforcement is also is a key for our study. Cain and Bardo(2010) explain that a continuous reinforcement schedule means one response will be emitted after the presentation of a reinforcer. In my point of view, using a continuous reinforcement schedule for our university learning may lead us to achieve the rewards, but not to maintain a appropriate attitude towards learning. Therefore, a variable interval schedule may become efficient for studying, because we should not be rewards-orientated, sort of occurrences of a response in variable time are reinforced could be better way in order to recognize the goals of learning.

    "                        '''Exactly. As 2015_1_S262 has stated, the favorable behavior will tend to repeated after gaining some rewards. Therefore, we can use a little bit of rest or some reward as an incentive to strengthen our effort on studying. However, Tomina and Takahata (2012, p. 91) illustrate that \"Animals learn to discriminate signals for reward from those for nonreward\". In university, rewards are not attached to all kind of task or work, we may not only focus on the one with rewards. In contrary, punishment can be found in a majority of assignment. As we all have to be responsibility-bearing, punishment like deducting grading may weakens a response, such as 2015_1_S264 mentioned, being a deadline fighter. It is not difficult to figure out the theory of law of effect implied in our university study, as a result, it is at a high level that we can apply the operant conditioning concepts to improve our learning in the university life in the Polyu.

    "                        '''Thank you for 2015_1_S218's ideas and I agree that variable ratio schedule will be a better way for our studying. Once a behavior has been learnt, variable ratio schedule can create a high steady rate of responding ( Skinner, 1997). Originally, I think that getting a reward after passing a period of time can enhance our motivation for studying. But indeed, this will make us put less effort because we can get the gift as long as we wait. At the same time, variable ratio schedule provides us a driving force to finish the assignment. Since we don't know after finishing which task will we be rewarded, we can keep on working hard until we get the gift, and we will also in hope of the next one, passion can thus be created and the behavior (working hardly) can be repeated. So if we are planning to decide a suitable strategy, variable ratio schedule of reinforcement should be required. Reference:Skinner, B. F. & Ferster, C. B. (1997).

But if we apply the variable interval schedule into our university studying, the variable should not be the timing of the assessment, but the rewards of accomplishing the assessment. It is because student are not fighting for the assessment, but the rewards. Therefore, in my point of view, the variable interval schedule can be applied in the frequency of the rewards, and the time of assessments can be as usual. This make us keep on having revision, but the goal is not for having the assessment, it is for gaining the reward. In the process, we can thus tend to repeat the action(studying).''',\n",
    "                        '''Operant conditioning is the learning where voluntary behavior is applied (Ceccarelli & White, 2015), and the procedure learning a voluntary behavior is named operant conditioning (Skinner, 1938). According to law of effect developed by Thorndike (1911, cited from Ceccarelli & White, 2015), actions accompanied by pleasant results will be repeated while those with upset consequences tending to not be repeated. For a academically well-behaved university students, it is essential to set up clear goals, maintain high efficiency, and reflect and adapt regularly to adjust to the best pattern of studying. In contrast, the enemies against satisfying study mode are procrastination, distraction and bad time-management. In order to improve my learning in university life, increasing habits approved by good study patterns while declining harmful ones is necessary. Here, habits can be interpreted as voluntary behavior stated above. Using law of effect, it is wise of me to reward myself after doing something suiting the good study patterns and punish myself after behaviors of bad ones. For example, if I finish a due early, I would treat myself with a palatable meal; and if I procrastinate until the deadline, I would punish myself by restrain the time of entertainment. These rewards/punishments, interpreted as pleasant/upset consequences, will help me to increase/decrease corresponding actions for I will have the intention to repeat/decline doing certain things. Besides, the good/bad grades are greater rewards/punishments for my study behavior, yet in order to receive pleasurable ones instead of depressing ones, I had better use smaller stimulation to form beneficial voluntary behaviors in advance. This application of operant conditioning is thus helpful to my enhancement of learning in my university life. ReferencesCeccarelli, S & White, J. (2015). Psychology. (4th ed. ). : Pearson Education.

    "                        '''As 2015_1_S264 has introduced, reinforcement is surely a significant element in operant conditioning. Within this scope, there are two sorts of reinforcers, which are items or events that strengthen the followed responses, primary reinforcer and secondary reinforcer, fulfilling basic needs and linked to primary reinforcer respectively (Ceccarelli & White, 2015). In 2015_1_S264’s case for example, the delicious meal and interesting movies serve partially, conditionally both these reinforcers and promote the responses they’re following, for example finishing a chapter. Furthermore, there are different reinforcements that we can apply to our study in university life. Positive reinforcement occurs when a response is rewarded in terms of a certain stimulus (Azrin, 1961), while negative reinforcement happens when an antipathetic element is removed conditionally (Wilson, 1991). Apparently, 2015_1_S264’s delicious meals and interesting movies are positive reinforcement. Additionally, in our study in university life, we can also apply negative reinforcement. Critically, studying hard on a task itself serves a negative reinforcement, to some extent, for the procedure is painstaking, yet on the condition that we finish a task, the unpleasant feeling is removed and thus promote us to do more similar things as “finishing a task”.

    "                        '''Thanks 2015_1_S264 and Yim for introducing fixed interval schedule and punishment, and illustrating positive punishment, respectively. Similar to positive punishment, negative punishment is also a condition of a stimulus that decreases the behavior, but this condition is removal (Gazzaniga, Heatherton, Halpern & Heine, 2006). A vivid example to negative punishment is the consequence of procrastination. Generally, for me at least, if I procrastinate to do my assignment, say, a journal, I actually didn’t do much things meaningful before doing the assignment; I’ll just hang around and do other irrelevant issues. Eventually, the deadline approaches and I started to really get involved into the journal, in panic, for as we all know, a journal requires plenty of research and time. I may be working all day and all night to finish it, and thus negative punishment occurs, for my smooth mood, enough time to do other things and adequate sleep time are removed sadly. Additionally, as Yim indicated, cramming often leads to unsatisfactory result, so procrastination, to some extent also removes the good grades from us. Therefore, punishments are supposed to decrease the tendency that students procrastinate, or cram, and thus can be applied to the study in university life. I think the discussion of different kinds of stimuli/responses in operant conditioning and their examples is almost sufficient. Next, we should focus more on the patterns/schedules of these stimuli, as 2015_1_S264 suggested, and I think we may draw a strategy based on the concepts after we have sorted and illustrated them out.

In order to strengthen the intention to repeat certain superior behaviors of study in university, as these behaviors such as finishing an essay on time are not settled according to certain time interval but accomplishment, I suggest it is better to apply a variable ratio schedule in study in university in order to build a stronger link between the good behavior itself with the reward and thus enhance the intention to repeat that good behavior that contributes to superior study in university.
